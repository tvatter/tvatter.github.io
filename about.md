I am a PhD Candidate at McGill University in the Surveillance Lab. My training is in epidemiology, statistics, and geographic information science. I'm interested in statistical computing (primarily in R), best practices in reproducible research, data visualization, Bayesian inference and computation, spatial and spatial-temporal methods, and statistics education in applied disciplines like epidemiology.

In my thesis, I'm trying to address some practical methodological challenges in environmental public health surveillance. My data all come from the BC Centre for Disease Control. I'm using wildfire smoke (as a source of fine matter particulates) from British Columbia and corresponding respiratory-related healthcare utilizations as a case study for my work. Most of my research is also relevant to acute environmental public health surveillance in general, such as heat waves. I'll elabourate on this soon, hopefully with some cool conceptual and data graphics. I've also been involved in other research projects during my degree, mostly looking at the spread of infectious disease such as Ebola.

I also really like knitting, yoga, podcasts, and dogs.
