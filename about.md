## I'm Thibault Vatter, a statistician and data enthusiast

I recently finished my PhD working with prof. [Val√©rie Chavez-Demoulin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ckwRJWAAAAAJ&hl=fr) on [generalized additive models for multivariate distributions](https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_E1AD7D2DCF57.P001/REF) at the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. After a brief transition phase as a PostDoc with prof. [Anthony C. Davison](http://stat.epfl.ch/) and [Suzanne de Treville](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hubUU3AAAAAJ&hl=en), I recently moved to New York with my wife, [Fanny Vatter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fanny-vatter-31886480), who accepted a position at Weill Cornell Medical College.

## Research interests

* Multivariate statistics and copula-based dependence modeling
* Semiparametric estimation
* Applied statistics
* Computational statistics and software

My main research interest is at a crossroads between two fields, namely multivariate statistics and semiparametric estimation. For instance, I work on copula-based extensions of generalized additive models to let multivariate distributions depend smoothly on the values of covariates/predictors. I also study a nonparametric copula-based solution to classification, least-squares and quantile regression problems. 

Apart from statistical methodology, I have a strong interest in applied research, which encourages learning about the broadest diversity of topics and collaborating with the widest variety of people. For instance, I have had the opportunity to work with a molecular biologist (i.e, my wife) on the analysis of gene expression in the context of breast cancer research, with financial engineers on foreign exchange rate prices with applications to high frequency trading, with operations researchers on intra-daily sales of grocery stores in order to optimize a supply-chain, or with climatologists on meteorological records with the aim of removing non-climatic changes such as relocations or changes in instrumentation.  

Finally, I spend a lot of time writing statistical software. I contribute to, develop and maintain several R packages as well as a C++ library. Occasionally, I also write code in Python and MATLAB and you can find an overview of my projects [here](https://tvatter.github.io/software/).
